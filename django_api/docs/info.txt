In this Django restful API we have created two apps posts and universities.

The @api_view decorator for working with function based views.
The posts apps following function base view styles.

The APIView class for working with class-based views.
The universities apps following class base view style.

Login and Logout Api has been defined in posts.serializers and posts.views and removed
all django login admin style which shows the user login as resuful api admin. To give
some permisstion we have used some of the permission styles to tell the user what sort
of permission the new user can have for example (is_staff, is_superuser, is_active).

request.POST  # Only handles form data.  Only works for 'POST' method.
request.data  # Handles arbitrary data.  Works for 'POST', 'PUT' and 'PATCH' methods.





The posts apps we used @api_view decorator for working with function based views

The universities apps has been created only to use different way restful api unse APIView class-based views.

We will not use JASONResponse in the views anymore.
